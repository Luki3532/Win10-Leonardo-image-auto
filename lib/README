This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries:

|--lib
|  |--Foo
|  |  |--Foo.h
|  |  |--Foo.cpp
|  |--Bar
|  |  |--Bar.h
|  |  |--Bar.cpp
|  |- README
|--src
   |- main.cpp

Each library should contain a header file (*.h) and source file (*.cpp).
